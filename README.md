> A secure, fully functional Cisco-based small business network designed for **HSK Company** — supporting Management, Operations, and Sales departments with VLAN segmentation, inter-VLAN routing, DHCP automation, PAT internet access, SSH remote management, and TFTP configuration backup.

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates end-to-end design and implementation of a **small business network** using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network supports three internal departments with isolated VLANs, automated IP management, secure internet access, and encrypted remote administration — reflecting real-world SMB network deployments.

## Network Architecture

### Departments & VLANs

| VLAN | Department | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| VLAN 10 | Management | IT administration and network management |
| VLAN 20 | Operations | Core business operations team |
| VLAN 30 | Sales | Customer-facing sales team |

### Design Pattern
- **Router-on-a-Stick** — single router interface with sub-interfaces for inter-VLAN routing
- **Trunking** — 802.1Q trunk between router and switch carrying all VLANs
- **PAT** — all internal hosts share a single public IP for internet access

---

## Technologies Implemented

### Network Design
- **VLAN Segmentation** — isolated broadcast domains per department
- **802.1Q Trunking** — VLAN traffic between router and switch
- **Router-on-a-Stick** — inter-VLAN routing via sub-interfaces
- **Subnetting** — custom IP addressing scheme per VLAN

### IP Services
- **DHCP** — automated IP assignment for all department VLANs
- **PAT (Port Address Translation)** — internet access for all internal hosts via single public IP
- **Default routing** — traffic forwarding to ISP gateway

### Security & Management
- **SSH** — encrypted remote device management (Telnet disabled)
- **TFTP Backup Server** — automated configuration backup and restoration
- **Access Control** — privileged access restricted via AAA-style local authentication

---

## Key Accomplishments

- Designed a complete multi-department VLAN network from scratch
- Configured Router-on-a-Stick for inter-VLAN communication
- Automated IP assignment across all VLANs using DHCP pools
- Enabled internet access for all departments via PAT
- Secured remote management using SSH — Telnet fully disabled
- Implemented TFTP-based configuration backup and verified restore process
- Verified end-to-end connectivity across all VLANs and to the internet

## Implementation Steps

| Step | Task |
|------|------|
| 1 | IP addressing scheme and subnet planning |
| 2 | Switch VLAN creation and port assignment |
| 3 | Trunk port configuration between router and switch |
| 4 | Router sub-interface configuration (Router-on-a-Stick) |
| 5 | DHCP pool creation per VLAN |
| 6 | PAT configuration for internet access |
| 7 | Default route to ISP gateway |
| 8 | SSH configuration and Telnet disabling |
| 9 | TFTP server setup and config backup |
| 10 | End-to-end connectivity testing |

## Real-World Relevance

Small business networks are the foundation of enterprise networking. This project demonstrates skills applicable to:
- **Network Administrator** roles — VLAN, DHCP, and routing configuration
- **Security+ / CCNA** exam domains — NAT, VLANs, SSH, access control
- **SOC Analyst** roles — understanding segmented network traffic flows
- **PhD research** — baseline network architecture for security research environments
